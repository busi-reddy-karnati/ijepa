Model configs that are run already are present in configs/
If we want already trained models, check for checkpoints specified in Pretrained models: Readme

Specify the run configs in configs.yaml

The batch_size parameter from the configs.yaml file is used to specify the number of samples that will be processed
together in one forward/backward pass of the model during training. This parameter is typically used to configure the
data loader in the training script.

forward pass is the process of inputting data to the model and generating an output.
backward pass is the process of computing the gradients of the model's parameters with respect to a loss function.

The crop_size parameter in the configs.yaml file specifies the size to which images will be cropped during preprocessing.
This is typically used to ensure that all images fed into the model have a consistent size, which is necessary for
batch processing in neural networks.

aspect ratio: ratio of width to height of an image
These are the parameters that are used to configure the data loader in the training script.
  allow_overlap = args['mask']['allow_overlap']  # whether to allow overlap b/w context and target blocks
    patch_size = args['mask']['patch_size']  # patch-size for model training
    num_enc_masks = args['mask']['num_enc_masks']  # number of context blocks
    min_keep = args['mask']['min_keep']  # min number of patches in context block
    enc_mask_scale = args['mask']['enc_mask_scale']  # scale of context blocks
    num_pred_masks = args['mask']['num_pred_masks']  # number of target blocks
    pred_mask_scale = args['mask']['pred_mask_scale']  # scale of target blocks
    aspect_ratio = args['mask']['aspect_ratio']  # aspect ratio of target blocks
